  howToReach: "Cherrapunji (Sohra) is 56 km south of Shillong (1.5 hours by road) and 150 km from Guwahati (4 hours). Shared taxis and private cars are readily available from both cities. The drive from Shillong is scenic, winding through Khasi villages and cloud forests."
  bestTime: "September to May. The monsoon months (June–August) bring extraordinary rainfall — up to 2,500 mm in a single month — making trails slippery and waterfalls dangerously powerful. October–March is ideal for trekking, with dry trails and comfortable temperatures."
  entryFee: "Nohkalikai Falls viewpoint: ₹20. Mawsmai Cave: ₹20. Living root bridge treks: free (community-maintained trails). Local guides available for ₹500–1,000 per day."
  recommendedDuration: "2–3 days. One day for waterfalls and Mawsmai Cave, one full day for the Nongriat living root bridge trek (3,500 steps down and back up), and an optional day for the lesser-known Rainbow Falls trail."
faqs:
  - question: "How difficult is the trek to the living root bridges?"
    answer: "The trek to the double-decker living root bridge at Nongriat involves roughly 3,500 steps — descending into a lush gorge and climbing back out. It takes 3–4 hours round trip for a moderately fit person. The steps are well-maintained but can be slippery after rain. Start early, carry water, and wear sturdy shoes with grip."
  - question: "Does it really rain that much in Cherrapunji?"
    answer: "Yes — Cherrapunji (and nearby Mawsynram) regularly record over 11,000 mm of annual rainfall, making this one of the wettest regions on Earth. However, almost all the rain falls between June and September. The rest of the year is surprisingly pleasant, with dry days, mild temperatures, and stunning post-monsoon waterfalls."
  - question: "What should I pack for Cherrapunji?"
    answer: "Rain gear year-round — even in the dry season, brief showers are common. Sturdy trekking shoes with good grip are essential for the root bridge trails. Layers for cool mornings (15–20°C in winter), a reusable water bottle, and a daypack for treks. Sunscreen is important despite the clouds."
  - question: "Can I visit the waterfalls without trekking?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Nohkalikai Falls and Seven Sisters Falls have roadside viewpoints with no trekking required. Mawsmai Cave is a short, mostly flat walk. Only the living root bridges require a serious trek. We can design an itinerary that balances adventure with accessibility."

Rain has a different meaning in Cherrapunji. In most places, rain is weather — something that happens to you, briefly, before the world resumes. In Sohra, as the Khasi people call their homeland, rain is the architect. It has carved every gorge, fed every waterfall, and shaped a culture that does not fight the deluge but weaves it into the fabric of life. Even the famous living root bridges — those astonishing structures grown over centuries from the aerial roots of fig trees — are a response to the rain. When wooden bridges rotted in the relentless monsoon, the Khasi simply grew bridges that the water could not destroy.

The double-decker root bridge at Nongriat is the most celebrated, and reaching it requires a descent of 3,500 stone steps into a gorge so green it seems to pulse with life. Ferns unfurl from every surface. Butterflies the size of your palm drift through shafts of light. And at the bottom, spanning a crystal stream, the bridge stands — not built but alive, its roots thickening year by year, its grip on the earth growing stronger with every monsoon. To cross it is to walk on something that has been growing for five hundred years and will outlast anything we could build.

Above the gorges, Cherrapunji offers a different kind of spectacle. Nohkalikai Falls, India's tallest plunge waterfall, drops over a thousand feet into a pool so blue it seems lit from within. Seven Sisters Falls cascades in seven silver threads down the face of the Khasi Hills. And at the edge of the plateau, where the land drops away into the Bangladesh plains far below, the clouds roll in like something from a myth — filling the valleys, swirling around the cliffs, and occasionally parting to reveal a world so vast and green that it stops you mid-sentence.

Cherrapunji does not simply show you beauty. It reminds you that the most enduring things on Earth are not the ones that resist nature, but the ones that grow with it.

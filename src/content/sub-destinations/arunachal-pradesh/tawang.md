practicalInfo:
  howToReach: "Tawang is 450 km from Guwahati via Tezpur and Bomdila (typically a 2-day drive with an overnight stop at Bomdila or Dirang). The nearest airport is Tezpur (320 km). Helicopter services operate seasonally from Guwahati."
  bestTime: "March to June and September to November. March–April brings rhododendron blooms, while October–November offers crystal-clear mountain views. Winter (December–February) is bitterly cold with heavy snowfall that can block Sela Pass."
  entryFee: "Inner Line Permit (ILP) required for Indian tourists (free, apply online via Arunachal Pradesh eILP portal). Foreign nationals need a Protected Area Permit (PAP) through a registered tour operator."
  recommendedDuration: "3–4 days in Tawang itself, plus 2 days for the journey from Guwahati/Tezpur (the drive is part of the experience). A week-long itinerary via Bomdila and Dirang is ideal."
faqs:
  - question: "How do I get an Inner Line Permit for Tawang?"
    answer: "Indian citizens can apply for a free ILP online through the Arunachal Pradesh eILP portal (arunachalilp.com). Processing takes 24–48 hours. You'll need an ID proof and passport-sized photo. We handle the complete permit process for all our guests."
  - question: "Is altitude sickness a concern in Tawang?"
    answer: "Tawang sits at 10,000 feet, and Sela Pass reaches 13,700 feet. Some visitors experience mild symptoms — headache, breathlessness, or fatigue. The two-day drive from the plains allows gradual acclimatisation. Stay hydrated, avoid alcohol on the first day, and ascend slowly. Most travellers adjust within a day."
  - question: "What are the road conditions like?"
    answer: "The road from Tezpur to Tawang is a mix of well-paved national highway and mountain roads. The Sela Pass section can be challenging, especially during or after rain. A sturdy SUV with an experienced driver is essential. We arrange all transport with drivers who know these roads intimately."
  - question: "Can I visit Tawang in winter?"
    answer: "Winter visits (December–February) are possible but demanding. Heavy snowfall can block Sela Pass for days, temperatures drop to -15°C, and many guesthouses reduce operations. However, a snow-covered Tawang Monastery is among the most breathtaking sights in the Himalayas — for those willing to brave the cold."

The road to Tawang is not a journey — it is an initiation. For two days, the land rises steadily from the Brahmaputra plains, through dense subtropical forest, past terraced villages where Monpa women weave in doorways, and finally up through the clouds to Sela Pass at 13,700 feet. Prayer flags snap in a wind that has crossed the Himalayas. Below, a frozen lake holds the sky in its stillness. You are no longer in the India you knew.

And then, around a bend that seems to open into the heavens themselves, Tawang appears — a valley suspended between earth and sky, crowned by the massive white-walled monastery that has watched over these mountains since 1681. The Tawang Monastery is not merely a building; it is a small city of prayer. Four hundred and fifty monks live within its walls, their chants rising at dawn and dusk like a sound the mountains have always known. Inside, a three-storey golden Buddha sits in luminous silence, surrounded by thangka paintings and butter-lamp flames that have not gone out in centuries.

Beyond the monastery, Tawang reveals itself in layers. There are alpine meadows carpeted in primulas. Glacial lakes — PTSO, Madhuri, Sangetsar — that mirror the peaks with uncanny precision. The ruins of the Tawang War Memorial, perched on a ridge, tell the story of 1962 with a solemnity that the surrounding beauty makes almost unbearable. And everywhere, the Monpa people move through their days with a warmth and gentleness that seems inseparable from the Buddhism they practice — offering butter tea to strangers, spinning prayer wheels as they walk, laughing with a lightness that only people who live close to the sky seem to possess.

To visit Tawang is to understand that some places are not destinations at all, but thresholds — points where the familiar world falls away and something older, quieter, and infinitely more vast takes its place.

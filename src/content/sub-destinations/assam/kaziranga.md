faqs:
  - question: "How likely am I to see a rhinoceros in Kaziranga?"
    answer: "Very likely — Kaziranga has the highest density of rhinos in the world. On a single morning jeep safari in the Central Range, most visitors spot multiple rhinos. The park estimates a 95%+ sighting rate during peak season."
  - question: "Which zone is best for a first-time visitor?"
    answer: "The Central Range (Kohora) is the most popular and wildlife-rich zone, with excellent rhino, elephant, and bird sightings. If you have a second day, add the Western Range (Bagori) for a quieter experience with equally impressive wildlife."
  - question: "Are elephant safaris still available?"
    answer: "Yes, elephant safaris operate from the Central and Western ranges at dawn (roughly 5:30–6:30 AM). They must be booked a day in advance at the park office. The experience is unique — elephants navigate tall grass that jeeps cannot enter."
  - question: "Is Kaziranga safe to visit? What about floods?"
    answer: "Kaziranga is completely safe for tourists during the open season (November–April). The park closes during monsoon when the Brahmaputra floods the grasslands. This annual flooding is actually essential — it replenishes the ecosystem and is part of what makes Kaziranga so biodiverse."

There is a moment, just before sunrise, when the world holds its breath in Kaziranga. The elephant grass stands silver with dew, fog drifts low across the floodplain, and somewhere in that pale stillness, something enormous moves. A shape — prehistoric, armoured, unhurried — emerges from the mist. The one-horned rhinoceros, a creature that has walked this land for millions of years, grazes as though time itself is an invention it never agreed to.

Kaziranga is not just a national park. It is a covenant between land and life — a place where the Brahmaputra River's annual floods sculpt an ever-shifting mosaic of tall grasslands, shallow beels, and dense tropical forest. This dynamic landscape supports one of the highest concentrations of large mammals anywhere on Earth. Tigers prowl the forest edges. Wild water buffalo stand sentinel in the marshes. Herds of Asian elephants move like grey clouds across the horizon.

For the traveller who arrives expecting a simple wildlife safari, Kaziranga offers something deeper: a confrontation with wildness in its purest form. The dawn elephant ride, swaying above the grass line, brings you face-to-face with rhinos so close you can hear them chewing. The jeep safari through the Central Range reveals a world where every turn produces a new silhouette — a hog deer frozen mid-stride, a Bengal florican taking flight, a python coiled on a sun-warmed mound.

And then there is the light. Kaziranga's light is different from anywhere else — filtered through grassland and river-mist, it turns everything golden and ancient, as though you are watching the world as it was before humans learned to name it.

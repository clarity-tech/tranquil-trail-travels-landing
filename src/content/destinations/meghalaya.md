  months: "September to May"
  note: "Post-monsoon (September-November) offers lush green landscapes, swollen waterfalls, and comfortable temperatures. Winter (December-February) is crisp and ideal for trekking. Spring (March-May) brings wildflowers and clear skies. The monsoon (June-August) is dramatic but some trails close due to heavy rainfall."
highlights:
  - title: "Living Root Bridges"
    description: "Meghalaya's Khasi and Jaintia communities have spent centuries training the aerial roots of Ficus elastica trees across rivers and gorges, creating living bridges that grow stronger with age. The double-decker root bridge at Nongriat is a feat of bio-engineering found nowhere else on Earth."

  - title: "Cherrapunji & the Reign of Rain"
    description: "Once the wettest place on the planet, Sohra (Cherrapunji) is a landscape forged by millennia of rainfall — dramatic gorge-edge viewpoints, seven-sister waterfalls, and limestone caves adorned with formations that took aeons to sculpt."
    icon: "🌧️"
  - title: "Dawki — The Crystal River"
    description: "The Umngot River at Dawki is so astonishingly transparent that boats appear to float on air. This surreal, glass-clear waterway along the India-Bangladesh border is one of Asia's most photographed natural wonders."

  - title: "India's Longest Cave Systems"
    description: "Meghalaya harbours over 1,700 mapped caves, including Krem Liat Prah — the longest cave in the Indian subcontinent. These limestone labyrinths of stalactites, underground rivers, and cathedral-sized chambers are a frontier for exploration."

  - title: "Mawlynnong — Asia's Cleanest Village"
    description: "This tiny Khasi hamlet has earned fame as one of Asia's cleanest villages, with flower-lined pathways, bamboo dustbins, and a community ethic of collective care. A living sky-walk platform offers canopy-level views of the Bangladesh plains below."

topExperiences:
  - title: "Trek to the Double-Decker Root Bridge"
    location: "Nongriat, East Khasi Hills"
    description: "Descend 3,500 stone steps through a subtropical jungle alive with birdsong and butterflies to reach the legendary double-decker living root bridge — two bridges stacked one above the other, each grown over centuries from the roots of a single rubber fig tree. Bathe in the natural rock pools nearby, then climb back as the canopy turns gold in the afternoon light. An overnight stay in a local homestay is recommended to experience the jungle at dawn."

  - title: "Sunrise at Nohkalikai Falls"
    location: "Sohra (Cherrapunji)"
    description: "At 1,115 feet, Nohkalikai is India's tallest plunge waterfall. Arrive at the viewpoint before sunrise to watch the first light catch the falling column of water as it drops into a turquoise plunge pool far below. The gorge fills with mist and birdsong, and on clear mornings, the Bangladesh plains shimmer on the horizon."

  - title: "Boating on the Crystal Umngot"
    location: "Dawki, West Jaintia Hills"
    description: "Glide across water so transparent that every pebble, fish, and shadow on the riverbed is visible beneath your boat. The Umngot at Dawki defies belief — it is less a river than a sheet of liquid glass stretched between forested hills. Visit in winter for the clearest conditions, and walk across the nearby suspension bridge to the Bangladesh border."

  - title: "Shillong Heritage & Music Walk"
    location: "Shillong"
    description: "Known as the 'Rock Capital of India,' Shillong pulses with a love of music inherited from its Scottish mission-town past. Walk through Police Bazaar, browse vinyl shops, visit the Don Bosco Museum of indigenous cultures, and end at a cafe where a local band plays blues as the pine-scented evening settles over the hills."

culturalHighlights:
  - title: "Matrilineal Society of the Khasi"
    description: "The Khasi are one of the world's few remaining matrilineal societies — children take their mother's surname, property passes through the female line, and the youngest daughter inherits the ancestral home. This ancient social structure shapes everything from family life to festival tradition."
  - title: "Nongkrem Dance Festival"
    description: "Held annually in November at Smit village, the Nongkrem Dance is the most important festival of the Khasi Syiem (chief) clan. Young men and women perform elaborate dances in traditional finery — silk robes, gold crowns, and ceremonial swords — to honour the goddess Ka Blei Synshar for a bountiful harvest."
  - title: "Wangala — The Hundred Drums Festival"
    description: "In the Garo Hills, the Wangala festival marks the end of the harvest season with the thunderous rhythm of a hundred nagara drums, bamboo flute melodies, and the exuberant Wangala dance. It is a sensory immersion into Garo tribal joy and thanksgiving."
  - title: "Khasi Cuisine & Jadoh"
    description: "Meghalaya's cuisine is bold, smoky, and deeply tied to the land. Jadoh — red rice cooked with pork and turmeric — is the state's signature dish. Other treasures include tungrymbai (fermented soybean chutney), doh khlieh (pork salad with onion and chilli), and the black sesame preparations unique to the Khasi table."

faqs:
  - question: "How physically demanding is the living root bridge trek?"
    answer: "The trek to the double-decker root bridge at Nongriat involves descending and ascending approximately 3,500 stone steps through a subtropical forest. It takes 2-3 hours each way. A moderate level of fitness is required. We recommend staying overnight at Nongriat to split the effort across two days."
  - question: "Is Meghalaya affected by the monsoon?"
    answer: "Meghalaya receives some of the heaviest rainfall on Earth between June and September. While the monsoon creates spectacular waterfalls and dramatic cloudscapes, some trails become inaccessible and road conditions deteriorate. We recommend visiting between October and May for the most comfortable experience."
  - question: "Do I need permits to visit Meghalaya?"
    answer: "No special permits are required for Indian or foreign nationals to visit Meghalaya. It is one of the most accessible states in Northeast India."
  - question: "What is the best way to reach Meghalaya?"
    answer: "Fly into Guwahati (Assam), which is the nearest major airport. Shillong is a scenic 3-hour drive from Guwahati via the Shillong-Guwahati Highway. We provide private transfers with experienced hill drivers for all our guests."
  - question: "Can I combine Meghalaya with other Northeast states?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Meghalaya pairs naturally with Assam (Kaziranga and Brahmaputra experiences are just hours away) and can be extended to include Arunachal Pradesh or Nagaland. We specialise in multi-state itineraries across Northeast India."
  - question: "Is Dawki river boating available year-round?"
    answer: "The Umngot River at Dawki is at its clearest between November and March, when rainfall is minimal and the water is at its most transparent. During the monsoon months, increased water flow reduces visibility. We schedule Dawki visits during optimal conditions."

Somewhere in the Khasi Hills, an old woman is watering the roots of a bridge. Not building it — growing it. She guides the aerial roots of a rubber fig tree across a bamboo scaffold spanning a jungle stream, tying and training them with betel-nut husks and patience. Her grandmother began this bridge. Her granddaughter will walk across it. This is Meghalaya — a place where architecture is alive, where the most permanent structures are the ones that grow, and where the relationship between human and forest is not one of conquest but of quiet, centuries-long conversation.

Rain made this land. Cherrapunji and its neighbour Mawsynram compete for the title of wettest place on Earth, and the monsoon here is not a season but a sculptor — carving limestone into cathedral caves, feeding waterfalls that drop a thousand feet into mist-filled gorges, and polishing the Umngot River at Dawki into a transparency so perfect that boats seem to levitate above their own shadows. The Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo peoples have not merely survived in this waterlogged world; they have thrived, building one of India's most fascinating cultures — matrilineal, music-loving, fiercely proud, and rooted in a reverence for the sacred groves that still crown their highest hills.

To travel through Meghalaya is to descend stone stairways into jungle valleys where root bridges hum with the vibration of a living thing, to stand at the edge of a gorge where clouds rise from below like the breath of the earth, and to sit in a Khasi kitchen where red rice and smoked pork are served alongside stories older than the hills. It is a place that asks you to slow down, to look closely, and to understand that the most extraordinary things are not built in a day — they are grown across generations.
